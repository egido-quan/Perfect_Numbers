# PERFECT NUMBERS

This code finds and shows the perfect numbers which are lower than the given number.

A perfect number is a number that can be obtained by the addition of all its divisors except itself. 

Examples:  

    - Divisors of 10 are 1, 2, 5 (we don't include 10). The addition is 8, then 10 is not a perfect number. 

    - Divisors of 6 are 1, 2, 3. The addition is 6, then 6 is a perfect number. 

There are very few perfect numbers
